*Flakiness*, or non-deterministic behavior of builds and tests, is a major and continuing impediment to software testing.
This workshop aims to bring together **industry professionals** and **academics** to discuss the wide effects of test flakiness, propose solution approaches, report on the industrial state of practice, and present empirical studies, as well as case studies.

# Status

We have submitted our workshop proposal to [ICSE 2024](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2024), which is currently under review.
If all goes well, we hope to see you in Lisbon!


# Organizing Committee

**Tim A. D. Henderson** is Senior Software Engineer at Google working on Google's proprietary CI platform: the Test Automation Platform (TAP).
Dr. Henderson specializes in testing, fault localization, semantic code clone detection, program analysis, graph mining, and databases.
<!-- Dr. Henderson received a Ph.D. at Case Western Reserve University and was advised by Dr. Andy Podgurksi. -->
<!-- Previous service includes: Track Chair for ICST 2022 Industry Track, organizing multiple instances of the CI/CD Industry Workshop (CCIW) at ICST (2020, 2021, 2023), and serving on the PC for AST 2022, and ICST 2019 (Tools and Demos). -->
<!-- Additionally, Dr. Henderson hosts the Google Journal Club which provides opportunities for the academic and industry testing communities to discuss recent work in Software Engineering. -->

**Owain Parry** is an early-career researcher working on flaky tests.
He published multiple papers in this field, including an extensive systematic literature review on the topic, a developer survey, and a machine learning-driven technique for detecting flaky tests.
<!-- Owain has served several times as a reviewer for Software Testing, Verification Reliability, a top journal in the field of software testing. He has also served as a student volunteer at ICSE 2022, ICST 2023, and as a session chair at AST 2022. -->

![Martin Gruber](images/martin_gruber.jpg)

**Martin Gruber** is a Software Engineer working with the BMW Group, where he is concerned with software quality and testing in CI environments.
Furthermore, he is currently finalizing his dissertation on the understanding and mitigation of test flakiness.
<!-- Furthermore, he is finishing up his dissertation (4th year PhD candidate), which he is planning to submit until the end of this year. -->
<!-- His research is concerned with the understanding and mitigation of test flakiness, on which he published multiple papers in well-known conferences. -->
<!-- He is supervised by professor Gordon Fraser, who holds the Chair for Software Engineering 2 at the University of Passau. -->


![Gordon Fraser](images/gordon_fraser.jpg)

**Gordon Fraser** is a full professor in Computer Science at the University of Passau, Germany. He received a PhD in computer science from Graz University of Technology, Austria, in 2007, worked as a post-doc at Saarland University, and was a Senior Lecturer at the University of Sheffield, UK. The central theme of his research is improving software quality, and his recent research concerns the prevention, detection, and removal of defects in software. He has been facing flaky tests in particular since the creation of the automated test generation tool EvoSuite. He has chaired major software engineering conferences (e.g., ASE, ISSTA, ICST) and workshops (e.g., Mutation, A-MOST, AST, TAIC-PART, CSI-SE, CSTVA, Gamify).



![Phil McMinn](images/phil_mcminn.jpeg)

**Phil McMinn** has been a Lecturer in the Computer Science department at the University of Sheffield since 2006. He was awarded his PhD in 2005, which was funded by DaimlerChrysler Research and Technology. He has published several papers in the field of search-based testing.
His research interests cover software engineering, with a particular focus on software testing, program transformation and agent-based systems and modelling. His research has been funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) to work on reducing oracles costs of testing, testing techniques for agent-based systems and the automatic reverse engineering of state machine descriptions from software.
